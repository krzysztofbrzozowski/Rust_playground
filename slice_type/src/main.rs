    // word but then cleared the string so our index was invalid? 
    // That code was logically incorrect but didnâ€™t show any immediate errors. 
    // The problems would show up later if we kept trying to use the first word index with an emptied string. 
    // Slices make this bug impossible and let us know we have a problem with our code much sooner.
